# Programming Resources

Below are some resources I gathered for easy online learning.  All for free.  'Tis a work in progress and will be added to accordingly.

## What You'll Need

### A Text Editor

This is where all of your editing will take place, for the most part.  They are all fully extensible in that they can be extended using plugins to fit the workspace of your choice.  These plugins can include code formatters, like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), which makes sure all of your written code is consistent with the rest.  Or, you may want to install a snippets plugin to help you autofill code that you often repeat, like [JavaScript Snippets for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xabikos.JavaScriptSnippets).  It's all up to you!

***Note:** This list is in order of personal preference.  I've tried them all.*

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (*This is the editor I currently use for ALL my projects*)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (*Created by Github!  Used to crash a lot for me though...*)
- [https://www.sublimetext.com/](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

### A Web Browser

First off... Duh.

If I have to explain why this is a necessity, you may be seeking the wrong line of work, jk.  Anyway, either way, in order of preference just for shits and giggles.  Adding links here just to maintain consistency.

- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) *(This is more or less the industry standard)*
- [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) *(Nightly built with cutting edge features)*
- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) *(Speaks for itself)*
- [Firefox Developer Version](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) *(Did you know that they had a development version??)*
- [Opera Browser](https://www.opera.com/) *(I mean... If you REALLY want to... Based on Chromium)*

***Note:** Microsoft Edge isn't listed here for what I would hope would be obvious reasons...*

## Online Courses

These courses cover an array of subjects, including but not limited, to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Ruby, Git, etc, etc.  

- FreeCodeCamp [www.freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) *(Great for ALL levels)*
- The Odin Project [https://www.theodinproject.com/](https://www.theodinproject.com/) *(Focuses mainly on web development)*
- Hackr [https://hackr.io/](https://hackr.io/)

## JavaScript

It was expressed that JavaScript was somewhat of a priority so this is where I started.  This will be added to as I find the time to add resources.

### Tutorials

- [https://javascript.info/](https://javascript.info/)
- [Tutorial Republic JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-tutorial/) *(Note: A bit dry, but whatevs...)*

### Videos

- [Programming with Mosh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upDLs1sn7g4&list=PLTjRvDozrdlxEIuOBZkMAK5uiqp8rHUax) (*My favorite!  I consume his other content.*)
-  [Learn JavaScript with Telusko](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDwSnnhl1Ng&list=PLsyeobzWxl7qtP8Lo9TReqUMkiOp446cV) (*Haven't watched him, but highly rated.*)
